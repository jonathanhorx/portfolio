# Using Machine Learning to Detect Insincerity in Online Forums
This is a group project I worked on for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.

**Skills demonstrated**
1. Python
2. TensorFlow
3. Numpy
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Recurrent Neural Networks
6. Importing and using pre-trained embeddings (GloVe, Paragram)
7. Model Evaluation
8. Hyperparameter Tuning


**Overview**
My team and I developed Deep Learning models using TensorFlow to classify questions as sincere or insincere, based on the Kaggle Quora Insincere Questions Classification dataset. We evaluated five architectures, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, leveraging pre-trained GloVe embeddings. Our final model achieved 90% test accuracy, outperforming the baseline accuracy of ~75%.
