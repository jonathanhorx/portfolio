**Skills demonstrated**
1. R
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Log transformation of variables
4. Statistical modeling: OLS regression and its required assumptions 
5. Statistical and practical interpretation of model's coefficients.

**Overview**
My team and I analyzed U.S. family earnings and medical expenses using 2023 survey data, checking OLS assumptions to ensure robustness. Our models showed a positive link between earnings and healthcare spending, offering insights for policymakers and insurers on income-driven healthcare costs.
