# Forecasting US Employment with Time Series Models
This is a solo project I worked on as part of my portfolio to demonstrate time series forecasting skills.

**Overview**
In this project, I analyzed U.S. employment data from 1990 to 2024, focusing on the Leisure and Hospitality sector. Using ARIMA models, I explored seasonality, trends, and the impact of shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. After evaluating non-seasonally adjusted and seasonally adjusted models, I selected the best-performing model based on residual diagnostics and RMSE. The results provided forecasts of employment trends and insights into how external events like the pandemic disrupt long-term patterns.
